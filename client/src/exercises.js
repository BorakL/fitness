Therefore, start with the dumbbell step-up, then graduate to the barbell step-up without using weight plates. Add the weight plates only after you have mastered balance, and always keep this exercise light./nUse the barbell step-up to develop balance, coordination, a strong core, and the unilateral functional strength of your lower body./nKeep your feet and knees pointing in the same direction, and keep your body upright./nControl the movement of slowly lifting and lowering yourself as much as possible. Do not spring up onto the bench or allow yourself to drop back down. If you can’t control the movement slowly without springing up or dropping down, use a lighter weight.",

        "tips": "The dumbbell Scott press was invented by Larry Dee Scott, the first ever winner of Mr. Olympia (in 1965). It’s one of few exercises that targets the lateral deltoid and one of very few exercises that manages to also significantly activate both the anterior deltoid and the posterior deltoid, making it a full-shoulder exercise./nThe dumbbell Scott press can be difficult to master. What’s more, most demonstrations of the exercise that you find online are completely wrong. Please refer to the video demonstrations below for detailed instructions of how to perform the exercise properly./nBecause the amount of elbow flexion in the dumbbell Scott press is minimal, the triceps brachii have not been listed as synergists and the exercise has been classified as an isolated pull movement.",

        "tips": "Keep your back straight and your body still. Avoid swinging the dumbbells./nThe biceps brachii flexes the elbow supinates the forearm, and weakly flexes the shoulder joint. The above execution (steps 1 and 2) incorporates all three movements, thus (arguably) promoting maximal biceps recruitment./nThe biceps is the primary elbow flexor when your forearm is supinated. When pronated or in neutral grip, your brachioradialis is the primary elbow flexor. Therefore, some instructors advise that you supinate early on the way up and return to neutral grip late on the way down. This, they argue, ensures that you keep the tension on the biceps instead of the brachioradialis. However, others argue that if you supinate gradually, as described above, the supination has to fight against more gravitational resistance, thus making the biceps work harder.",

Instead, raise your knees and carefully bring the dumbbells down onto your knees, after which the weight of the dumbbells will push your legs down and help you to sit up./nThe advantages of the dumbbell bench press over the barbell bench press are that it allows a greater range of motion and doesn’t allow your stronger side to make up for your weaker side. The dumbbell bench press also recruits more stabilizer muscles.",
